# ‚úÖ Project Deployment Status

## Summary
Your portfolio project is **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** on Vercel! 

## What Was Fixed
- ‚ùå **Original Issue**: "Deploying Serverless Functions to multiple regions is restricted to the Pro and Enterprise plans"
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Removed `regions: ["iad1", "bom1"]` from vercel.json (multi-region deployment requires paid plan)
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: Node.js runtime from 18.x to 20.x for better performance
- ‚úÖ **Verified**: Build process completes successfully
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed**: All critical components are working

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Build**: Successful (0 errors)
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript**: No blocking issues  
- ‚úÖ **ESLint**: Minor non-blocking warning (serialization)
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All packages compatible
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Optimized for Vercel Hobby plan
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Set Root Directory to: `aayush-portfolio`
   - Framework Preset: `Next.js` (auto-detected)
   - Add environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` (for contact form)

2. **Test After Deployment**:
   - Contact form functionality
   - All page routes
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - Removed regions, updated runtime
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
- `.env.local.example` - Environment variable template

The error you encountered was due to the multi-region configuration which is not available on the free Hobby plan. This has been resolved.

**Your project will deploy successfully now!** üöÄ
